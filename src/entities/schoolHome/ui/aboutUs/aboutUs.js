                </div>
                <div className={cls.footer__wrapper_descr}>
                    In 2012, when writing The One World Schoolhouse, I outlined how modern education developed and how
                    Khan Academy came to be. But, most importantly, the book outlines a vision for the future of both
                    in-person and online education given the tools we have and the need for many more people to
                    participate in the knowledge economy. Two years later, I founded Khan Lab School to test and refine
                    these ideas in an actual school setting. Today, our school has grown to encompass a Lower School
                    (K-5th), a Middle School (6th-8th) and an Upper School (9th-12th) that collectively serve over 280
                    students.
                </div>

                <div className={cls.footer__wrapper_list}>
                    <div className={cls.footer__wrapper_list_title}>
                        From our founding, the core ideas of the school have been:
                    </div>
                    <ul>


                        <li> â€¢ The personalization of pace with high expectations</li>
                        <li> â€¢ Opportunities for students to learn from one another</li>
                        <li> â€¢ Giving students the opportunity and tools to fill in their knowledge gaps and improve their
                            achievement
                        </li>
                        <li> â€¢ Learning that is not bound by time or space, and</li>
                        <li> â€¢ Blurring the arbitrary boundaries between elementary school, middle school, high school and
                            college
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div className={cls.footer__wrapper_descr}>
                    We believe in focusing on what really matters for studentsâ€™ lives (i.e., no busy work!). This
                    enables content knowledge, skill development, applied learning opportunities and collaboration to
                    reinforce each other rather than be in competition with each other. We value focusing on fewer
                    authentic student-driven applied experiences over many artificial, cookie cutter ones. We believe
                    that students can be extremely competitive in the broader world without having to be competitive
                    with their peers. Most importantly, we believe that student agency, mindfulness and resilience are
                    the most important skills in a world with too many stressed young people lacking a sense of purpose.
                </div>

                <div className={cls.footer__wrapper_descr}>
                    At Khan Lab School, all of our decisions are made through the lens of what is best for our students.
                    We tackle tough questions without ego, are results oriented, and have high expectations for our
                    school and our students.
